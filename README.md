I build web applications and backend systems with a focus on scalability, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

Most of my work is around:
- Next.js and React with TypeScript on the frontend
- NestJS, Node.js, and Express on the backend
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma
- Microservices using Redis, NATS, and Docker

I care about how systems behave in production, not just how fast they’re built. Clean architecture, sensible abstractions, and good developer experience matter to me.

I also use automated testing (Playwright) and tooling like Docker, Git, and CI/CD to keep things reliable.
