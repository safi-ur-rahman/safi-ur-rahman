## About

I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer focused on building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.  
I enjoy working across the stack — from intuitive frontend interfaces to robust backend architectures — with a strong emphasis on clean design, performance, and developer experience.

I’m particularly interested in distributed systems, microservice architectures, and modern DevOps practices.
