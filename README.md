I’m a full stack engineer who enjoys building systems that are easy to work with, scale well, and don’t fall apart under real-world usage. I spend most of my time working across backend-heavy applications, but I’m comfortable owning features end to end when needed.

On the frontend, I mainly work with Next.js and React using TypeScript, focusing on clean UI, predictable state, and maintainable code. On the backend, I build APIs and services with NestJS, Node.js, and Express, usually backed by PostgreSQL or MongoDB and structured around Prisma.

A lot of my experience is around microservice-based systems — designing services, handling async communication with NATS, using Redis where it makes sense, and running everything in Docker. I care about how systems behave in production, not just how they look in development.

I also put time into testing and reliability. I’ve used Playwright and Postman for automated and manual testing, and I like setting things up so issues are caught early rather than after deployment.

I’m always learning, especially around distributed systems, infrastructure, and better ways to ship and maintain software without over-engineering it.
