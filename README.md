I work on web applications and backend systems, mostly focused on making things scale without becoming hard to reason about.

Most of my time goes into:
- Next.js and React with TypeScript
- NestJS, Node.js, and Express
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma
- Microservices using Redis, NATS, and Docker

I tend to favor boring solutions that work, clear boundaries between services, and code that doesn’t need a long explanation six months later.

I also use automated testing (Playwright) and basic DevOps tooling like Docker, Git, and CI/CD to keep deployments predictable.
