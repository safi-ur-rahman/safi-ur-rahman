I work on web applications and backend systems, mostly focused on making things scale without becoming hard to reason about.

On the frontend, I usually work with Next.js and React using TypeScript. On the backend, I build APIs and services with NestJS, Node.js, and Express, typically backed by PostgreSQL or MongoDB and modeled with Prisma.

A lot of my work involves microservice-based systems — using Redis for caching and coordination, NATS for messaging, and Docker to keep environments consistent.

I tend to favor boring solutions that work, clear service boundaries, and code that still makes sense months later.

Automated testing with Playwright and a simple CI/CD setup help keep things predictable once they’re running in production.
